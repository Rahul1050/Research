Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project on automating the analysis of stock data, generating trading signals, and evaluating the performance of trading strategies. The project employs machine learning models, particularly focusing on Gradient Boosting Regressor, to assess the importance of key features in trading strategies.

Objectives
To automate the process of analyzing stock data.
To generate trading signals based on the analyzed data.
To evaluate the performance of different trading strategies.
To identify the most effective combinations of indicators for stock trading.
Methodology
The methodology involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Gathering historical stock data.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from raw data to use in modeling.
Model Training: Using machine learning models to predict stock price changes.
Signal Generation: Developing trading signals based on model predictions.
Strategy Evaluation: Testing and evaluating the performance of different trading strategies.
Data
The data used in this project includes historical stock prices, volumes, and other relevant financial indicators. The dataset is sourced from reliable financial data providers.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is a crucial part of this project. It involves creating new features from the raw data, such as:

Volume/Float ratio
Market Force Indicator
Volume per minute
Market Cap per minute
Float per minute
These features are used to train the machine learning models.

Modeling
The primary model used in this project is the Gradient Boosting Regressor. The target variable for the model is "Change," which represents the change in stock price. The model is trained on historical data and used to predict future price changes.

Results
The results section includes the performance metrics of the models, the effectiveness of the generated trading signals, and the evaluation of different trading strategies. Detailed analysis and visualizations are provided to illustrate the findings.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of using machine learning for stock data analysis and trading strategy development. The findings highlight the importance of feature engineering and model selection in predicting stock price changes and generating effective trading signals.

Future Work
Future work will focus on:

Enhancing feature engineering techniques.
Exploring additional machine learning models.
Implementing real-time trading strategies.
Conducting further backtesting and validation.
